  in bootstrap anyway, especially header tags which inherently imply a specific
  document structure which modal dialogs in no way can represent!)

    The BS checkbox appears too low, due to the top margin, when used with a label
    in the recommended manner. 
    Note: I don't understand why BS handles checkbox styling as they do, turning
    the checkbox into relatively posiioned and then pushing the label to checkbox
    to the left and down (at the same time given the container extra margin to
    accomodate this.) Anyway, we roll with it but try to patch up the styling
    as it breaks.
